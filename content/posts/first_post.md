Well, I wrapped up my tasks at work today and decided to write a few initial thoughts here on this blog.

I have some ideas about what I’d like this space to become. Calling it a “blog” might be a bit bold on my part, since I don’t really expect to have any audience at all. What I want is simply a place to write down what I’m learning—not only related to work, but also about my adventures in the mountains or while traveling.

On a more technical level, I hope to use this space to share reflections on papers I may write—or others that I read—, implementations of algorithms and papers that I want to experiment with and document (I believe that forcing myself to write things down will help me organize my thoughts, which in turn will help me). I’d also like to include personal DIY projects and maybe something about my journey as both a worker and a PhD student.

On a more personal level, I think taking the time to reflect on my trips and adventures might help me plan new ones, while also creating something I can look back on in the future.

Just as important as deciding what this space could be is defining what it will not be. I don’t want it to be a purely technical blog; I don’t want to feel pressured to write scientific theories or to prove every hypothesis that comes up in my research and projects; I don’t intend for it to reach a large audience; I don’t want it to be only about my travels, and I definitely don’t want it to become overloaded with features or complexity.

Having written down what I want and what I don’t want, I think I’m now in a good place to define its purpose clearly: **a personal blog, from me to just a few people 😏, where I can write things that help me organize my ideas!**
