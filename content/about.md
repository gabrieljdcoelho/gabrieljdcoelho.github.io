Hi, I’m Gabriel — a Data Scientist and AI Engineer who loves working at the intersection of data, research, and real-world impact.

Right now, I split my time between industry and academia. At **CEGID**, I apply machine learning and data science to projects that bring direct value to the business. At the same time, I’m pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Systems and Technologies at the University of Minho, where my research focuses on synthetic data and deep learning as tools to make AI systems more private, fair, and trustworthy.

What excites me the most about my work is the balance between solving practical problems with data and pushing the boundaries of research. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, learning continuously, and sharing knowledge along the way. For more information about my research and work, please check out my [CV](/cv.pdf)

Outside of work, I’m passionate about traveling, mountaineering, alpine climbing, and riding my motorcycle — adventures that challenge me, recharge my energy, and give me new perspectives 🏔️🏍️✈️.
