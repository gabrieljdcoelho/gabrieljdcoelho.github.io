Hi! Iâ€™m Gabriel, a Data Scientist / AI Engineer with experience across both academia and industry. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Systems and Technologies at the University of Minho, where my research focuses on using **Synthetic Data and Deep Learning** to build more **private and fair AI systems**.  
At **CEGID**, I apply machine learning and data science to real-world projects that bring direct value to the business. Iâ€™ve worked in academic research, but I also love solving practical problems with data.  

I bring an **analytical, ambitious, and resilient mindset**, and Iâ€™m always curious to learn something new and share knowledge along the way. ðŸš€
